# Property-based testing of GraphQL APIs replication

This repository contains two folders. "Implementation" contains the implementation of the method and all source for the experiments performed. The "graphql-toy" contains the source of the small example application used for the fault finding of known faults.

This is provided as a proof-of-concept, not as production software.
